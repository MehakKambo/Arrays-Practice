# Arrays-Practice
This is to practice the use of arrays.

# Instructions
We have 9 different practice problems which includes adding an element at a certain index, finding the average of the array, finding the index of an element in an array, making
a copy of an array into a new one, finding min and max values in an array, reversing an array using different methods, finding duplicates- int and String values, which may be 
double or triple duplicates in a single array.

You are welcome to make any changes but with test cases!
